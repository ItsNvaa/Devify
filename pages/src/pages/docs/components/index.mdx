# Introduction

## What is Devify?

<a href="https://devify.my.id">**Devify**</a> is a Fake API designed to provide developers
with a testing and development environment for their applications

---

With Devify, developers can mimic the behavior of real APIs without relying on actual backend systems or production data. This helps to streamline the development process by eliminating dependencies and potential bottlenecks.

Whether you are building a web or mobile application, Devify can be a valuable tool in your development workflow. It helps ensure that your application is robust and fully functional by allowing you to thoroughly test API interactions before deploying to a live environment.

---

### Example Code

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products?limit=3`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

### Response

```json
[
  {
    "products": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "price": "...",
        "category": "...",
        "location": "...",
        "rating": "...",
        "stock": "...",
        "image": "..."
      },
      {
        "id": 50,
        "title": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "price": "...",
        "category": "...",
        "location": "...",
        "rating": "...",
        "stock": "...",
        "image": "..."
      }
    ],
    "total": 50,
    "status": 200
  }
]
```

## Why?

The idea behind Devify arose from a simple yet profound realization: the need for a reliable, customizable, and easily accessible fake API tool for developers.

Whether you're working on a web application, mobile app, or any other software project, you may face issues when you can't easily access real APIs due to cost or reliability constraints.

Devify was born out of the desire to solve these
issues and to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique needs of
developers.

---

## The Intuitive Fake API

One compelling reason to use Devify is its ability to thoroughly test API interactions. APIs play a crucial role in modern applications, allowing different systems to communicate and exchange data.

By using Devify, you can test these interactions comprehensively before deploying your application to a live environment.

This helps identify any issues or miscommunications, reducing the risk of bugs or errors affecting your users' experience.

Another advantage of Devify is its versatility. It supports both web and mobile application development, making it a valuable tool for developers working on different platforms. This flexibility allows you to streamline your workflow and centralize your testing and debugging processes, regardless of the type of application you are building.
