# All Users

Devify's user data is purposely diverse, **helping you simulate different user interactions and demographics.** This makes it an invaluable tool for quality assurance, ensuring that your application performs as expected in real-world situations.

When using Devify, **developers can effortlessly retrieve a comprehensive list of users from their applications.** This feature provides invaluable insight into how their application interacts with user data, ensuring that everything functions smoothly.

**With just a simple API call, developers can access a wealth of user information, which is essential for testing and refining their applications.** Devify's helps developers streamline the development process and identify any potential issues before deploying their applications to the real world.

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of user data, you have several effective options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve JSON data from Devify's users endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to initiate HTTP requests directly from the command line or within your scripts. Below are some typical use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/users"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/users"
```

## Fetching Data

Fetching data is a fundamental aspect of application development, and Devify simplifies this process with its user-friendly API. Whether you're working on a web or mobile application, **Devify's allows you to effortlessly access user information for testing and development purposes.**

This functionality is invaluable when you need to populate your application with sample user data, simulate real-world scenarios, or ensure that your app can handle a diverse user base. **By making API requests to [https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts](https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts) you can retrieve user profiles, including names, emails, and other relevant information, to simulate various user interactions within your application.**

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function users() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/users?limit=3`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

users().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/users?limit=3`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

#### Start your Application

```bash
$ node main.js
```

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "password": "...",
    "age": 31,
    "gender": "...",
    "picture": "...",
    "address": {
      "country": "...",
      "city": "..."
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "password": "...",
    "age": 22,
    "gender": "...",
    "picture": "...",
    "address": {
      "country": "...",
      "city": "..."
    }
  }
]
```

## HTTP Client Module

**If you're a developer looking to test your application with realistic user data, Devify's Fake API is the perfect playground.** Using an HTTP client module like [Axios](https://axios-http.com), you can easily retrieve all user information from Devify. Here's how:

### Installing

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Visit [https://axios-http.com](https://axios-http.com) to view the full documentation.

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function users() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/users`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

users().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}v1/users`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

You can now work with the retrieved user data in your application. **Devify's Fake API provides a range of user information, including names, email addresses, and more, making it a valuable resource for development and testing.**

**By following these steps and using Axios, you can easily integrate Devify's Fake API into your development environment**, allowing you to access and manipulate user data for testing and building your applications.
