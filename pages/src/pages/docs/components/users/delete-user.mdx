# Delete User

**Deleting a user on Devify is a straightforward process, making it easy to manage your user base during the development and testing phases of your application.** Whether you're cleaning up test data or removing inactive accounts, Devify's user management tools simplify the process, allowing you to focus on building and refining your application with confidence.

**The process of deleting a user in Devify is straightforward and intuitive, adhering to industry-standard best practices.** Developers can initiate the user deletion operation through HTTP requests, making it an easy and seamless process.

## How to Use It?

To access the entire array of user data, you have various efficient options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve JSON data from Devify's user endpoint.

When using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to execute HTTP requests through the command line or within your scripts. Below are some typical use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/users/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/users/key/64a975166d8d44a6a0b70cf0"
```

## Fetching Data

**Devify simplifies the process of deleting a user. It provides a user-friendly and developer-centric API for removing user accounts.** Here's a high-level overview of the steps to delete a user in Devify:

### Delete User By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteUser() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/1`, { method: "DELETE" });
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteUser().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

### Delete User By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteUser() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/users/key/64a975166d8d44a6a0b70cf0`,
      { method: "DELETE" }
    );
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteUser().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

### Delete User By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/1`, { method: "DELETE" })
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete User By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/key/64a975166d8d44a6a0b70cf0`, {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## HTTP Client Module

To delete a user using [Axios](https://axios-http.com) and **Devify**, you'll first need to set up your development environment, including installing [Axios](https://axios-http.com). Once you have [Axios](https://axios-http.com) at your disposal, you can make a DELETE request to the **Devify** API, simulating the action of deleting a user account. Here's a simple example:

### Delete User By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteUser() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/1`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteUser().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Delete User By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteUser() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/users/key/64a975166d8d44a6a0b70cf0`
    );

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteUser().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

### Delete User By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/1`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete User By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/users/key/64a975166d8d44a6a0b70cf0`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
