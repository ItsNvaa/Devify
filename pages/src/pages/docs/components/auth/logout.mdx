# Logout

In Devify, the process of logging out a user is seamless and straightforward. **Developers can initiate the logout action by making a POST request to the "v1/auth/logout" endpoint. This request instructs the API to terminate the user's session, effectively logging them out.** It's an essential step to ensure the security of a user's account and data.

## How to Use It?

To log out a user, you have several elegant options at your disposal. You can use tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or leverage the power of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully request JSON data from Devify's user endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can use it to initiate HTTP requests from the command line or within your scripts. Here are some common use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl --cookie-jar C:\cookies.json --cookie C:\cookies.txt -X POST https://api-devify.my.id/v1/auth/logout
```

## Fetching Data

When it comes to Devify, logging out a user is a seamless process. **Developers can utilize the Devify API to perform a user logout operation with ease.** This operation ensures that the user's session is securely terminated, enhancing the security and privacy of their data.

**Developers can make use of Devify's fake user data to simulate real-world scenarios.** By making API requests to log out users, they can verify that the application effectively ends a user's session, revoking access and enhancing security.

## Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function logout() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/auth/logout`, {
      method: "POST",
    });
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

logout().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/auth/logout`, {
  method: "POST",
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

Devify, a Fake API designed to offer developers a testing and development environment, provides an ideal platform to experiment with various API interactions. **One common operation in web applications is logging out a user, which typically involves sending an HTTP request to invalidate the user's session or refresh token.** In this guide, we will explore how to perform a user logout using the [Axios](https://axios-http.com) HTTP client in conjunction with Devify.

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function logout() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.post(`${baseUrl}/v1/auth/logout`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

logout().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .post(`${baseUrl}/v1/auth/logout`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
