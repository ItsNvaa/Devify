## Images Files Size

In the world of application development, images play a crucial role in enhancing the user experience. From profile pictures to product images, managing image files effectively is a common task for developers.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that Devify imposes certain restrictions on the size of image files that can be uploaded. These limitations are in place to ensure the efficient functioning of the platform and to prevent any misuse of resources.

Devify typically has a 5MB maximum image file size limit to maintain a seamless development experience for all users. Developers should be aware of these size limits to ensure that their image files adhere to the platform's guidelines.

The 5MB limit serves as a reasonable boundary for developers to work with images within a controlled environment. While it may not accommodate extremely large or high-resolution images, it is well-suited for a wide range of testing scenarios.
