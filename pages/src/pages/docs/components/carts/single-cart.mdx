# Single Cart

**The simplicity and convenience of Devify make it an invaluable resource for developers looking to create and refine applications with robust shopping cart systems.** Devify's commitment to providing a realistic and efficient testing environment empowers developers to build high-quality applications that meet the demands of modern e-commerce and beyond.

As a developer, having access to a single cart within your application is crucial for fine-tuning and testing specific functionalities. **Enables developers to retrieve detailed information about a single shopping cart.**

**This includes the cart's contents, associated user details, and any other relevant data.** By accessing a single cart, developers can thoroughly test and debug their applications, ensuring that the shopping cart feature functions seamlessly.

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of carts data, you have several effective options available. You can utilize tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to efficiently retrieve the JSON data from Devify's carts endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to send HTTP requests from the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and examples:

Before you can access any cart data, it is essential to undergo the login process. For comprehensive documentation, please refer to the [Auth Login](/docs/v1/auth/login) section.

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts/1"
```

## Fetching Data

**Devify's intuitive and easy-to-use API ensures that developers can seamlessly integrate this functionality into their applications.** By obtaining single cart data, **developers can create engaging and responsive user experiences, update cart contents, and calculate prices accurately.**

To fetch data for a single cart from Devify, developers can make an HTTP GET request to the appropriate endpoint. **This request enables them to access detailed information about a specific cart, such as its contents, total price, and associated user.** This operation is crucial for applications that require real-time updates on the status of a particular shopping cart.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";
const token = "your_access_token";

async function cart() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

cart().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";
const token = "your_access_token";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

---

## HTTP Client Module

One common task in this scenario is retrieving details about a specific cart. **To achieve this, developers often turn to HTTP client modules like [Axios](https://axios-http.com).** [Axios](https://axios-http.com) is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies making HTTP requests, including GET requests to fetch data from an API.

Getting information about a single cart from Devify is straightforward when using [Axios](https://axios-http.com). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";
const token = "your_access_token";

const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
};

async function carts() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, { headers });

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

carts().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";
const token = "your_access_token";

const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
};

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, { headers })
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## Query Parameters

| Params | Data Types | Required |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| ID     | Integer    | Yes      |

---

## Authorization

**The Authorization Bearer Token is a digital credential that separates the spectators from the participants in the Devify playground.** It signifies that developers have been authenticated and authorized to make inquiries about individual carts.

This API endpoint requires developers to present a valid Authorization Bearer Token as a key to unlock a treasure trove of cart-related information. **This token serves as a digital seal of approval, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and manipulate cart data.**

To access this API endpoint, you need to include a Authorization Bearer Token in the request headers. This token is akin to a backstage pass, granting access to the inner workings of Devify's cart management system. To get the **Bearer Token** you must have to [login](/docs/v1/auth/login) with a valid credentials or [register](/docs/v1/auth/register).

If you're not include a Authorization Bearer Token in the request headers, you will get an error that say:

```json
{
  "TypeError": "Unauthorized",
  "messege": "You are not authorized to access this resource. Please provide valid credentials or authentication.",
  "status": 401
}
```
