# Delete Cart

Devify's user-friendly API system **enables developers to implement and examine the removal of items from a cart with ease.** This comprehensive testing environment allows you to verify that your application functions as expected when users wish to clear their shopping carts.

So, when it comes to testing and perfecting the cart deletion process in your application, **Devify stands as the ideal tool to help developers create an efficient and reliable experience for their users.** It's a critical part of the development process, and Devify simplifies it, offering a safe and controlled environment to ensure your application performs flawlessly.

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of cart data, you have several effective options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or leverage the versatility of [cURL](https://curl.se) to efficiently retrieve the JSON data from Devify's carts endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to execute HTTP requests via the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts/key/65192ab500df9423f8d42cf3"
```

## Fetching Data

One crucial operation offered by Devify. **allows developers to seamlessly remove items from a shopping cart, mimicking a real-world scenario.** Whether it's refining the checkout process or enhancing the user experience, **enables developers to assess how their applications handle cart modifications.**

Fetching data is another essential aspect of Devify. **Developers can retrieve data from the API to test how their applications respond to different scenarios.** Whether it's fetching product details, user information, or other critical data, Devify provides a safe and controlled environment for developers to fine-tune their data retrieval mechanisms.

### Delete Product By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteCart() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, { method: "DELETE" });
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteCart().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteCart() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/carts/key/65192ab500df9423f8d42cf3`,
      { method: "DELETE" }
    );
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteCart().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

### Delete Product By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, { method: "DELETE" })
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/key/65192ab500df9423f8d42cf3`, {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## HTTP Client Module

When working on your application's development and testing, it's essential to have the ability to manage and delete shopping carts. **In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to perform a cart deletion operation using the [Axios](https://axios-http.com) HTTP client module in conjunction with Devify**, a versatile Fake API created to provide developers with a reliable testing and development environment.

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteCart() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteCart().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteCart() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/carts/key/65192ab500df9423f8d42cf3`
    );

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteCart().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

### Delete Product By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/key/65192ab500df9423f8d42cf3`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
