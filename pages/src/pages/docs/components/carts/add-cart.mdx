# Add Cart

**Devify offers an intuitive API for adding items to a cart, allowing you to understand the process, perfect the user interface, and fine-tune your application's performance.** It's the ideal environment for developers who want to ensure that their cart functionality is smooth, reliable, and user-friendly.

Adding items to your cart is a fundamental aspect of e-commerce and online shopping applications. With Devify, developers can simulate this process effectively, **enabling them to test and fine-tune their cart management system with ease.**

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of cart data, you have various effective options at your disposal. You can utilize tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's carts endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to send HTTP requests from the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and examples:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{
  "userId": 5,
  "products": [
    {
      "productsId": 1,
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 21.99
    }
  ]
}' https://api-devify.my.id/v1/carts
```

## Fetching Data

In the world of application development, managing shopping carts is a fundamental aspect. With Devify, **you can effortlessly create and manipulate shopping carts to mimic real-world scenarios.** The process involves adding items to a cart and then fetching data related to these carts.

By utilizing Devify's, **you can simulate various user interactions, such as adding products to a cart, adjusting quantities, or removing items.** This functionality is essential for testing the robustness and efficiency of e-commerce and shopping applications

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function carts() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userId: 5,
        products: [
          {
            productsId: 1,
            quantity: 1,
            price: 21.99,
          },
        ],
      }),
    });
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

carts().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: 5,
    products: [
      {
        productsId: 1,
        quantity: 1,
        price: 21.99,
      },
    ],
  }),
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

Developers often encounter the need to interact with APIs in their applications, whether it's for fetching data, submitting forms, or managing user interactions.

A popular choice for making HTTP requests from the client-side is [Axios](https://axios-http.com), a promise-based **JavaScript** library. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to use [Axios](https://axios-http.com) to add a cart in a hypothetical scenario, working with a Fake API known as **Devify**.

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

const payload = {
  userId: 5,
  products: [
    {
      productsId: 1,
      quantity: 1,
      price: 21.99,
    },
  ],
};

async function carts() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.post(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts`, payload);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

carts().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

const payload = {
  userId: 5,
  products: [
    {
      productsId: 1,
      quantity: 1,
      price: 21.99,
    },
  ],
};

axios
  .post(`${baseUrl}/v1/carts/1`, payload)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## Payloads

| Payload    | Data Types | Required |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| UserId     | Integer    | Yes      |
| Products   | Arrays     | Yes      |
| ProductsId | Integer    | Yes      |
| Quantity   | Integer    | Yes      |
| Price      | Integer    | Yes      |

```json
{
  "userId": 5,
  "products": [
    {
      "productsId": 1,
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 21.99
    }
  ]
}
```
