# Middlewares

Middleware, in the context of Devify, serves as a crucial bridge between the client and the server, providing a range of functionalities that can significantly enhance the development and testing experience.

These intermediate software components are capable of processing, modifying, and enriching incoming and outgoing data, making Devify a valuable tool for developers.

## Rate Limitter

Developers can leverage this Rate Limiter Middleware to simulate real-world usage scenarios, measure the performance of their applications under various conditions, and ensure that their creations can withstand the demands of a production environment.

Devify's Fake API, combined with the Rate Limiter Middleware, empowers developers to optimize their applications with confidence.

This Rate Limiter Middleware sets a maximum limit of 80 requests per minute for each user or application interacting with Devify's Fake API. This feature ensures that developers can rigorously test and fine-tune their applications without overwhelming the system. By limiting the number of requests, Devify encourages responsible and efficient use of its platform.

When a user or application exceeds the 80-request limit within a minute, the Rate Limiter Middleware enforces a 1-minute delay before allowing additional requests. This delay not only prevents abuse but also provides a fair and equitable experience for all users.

It's a crucial component of Devify's commitment to maintaining a stable and reliable development environment.

These middlewares serve a variety of purposes within the Devify ecosystem. They can be employed to authenticate requests, validate data, log essential information, and even modify the response before it reaches the client.

Middlewares act as intermediaries between the client and the server, enhancing the development process by performing various functions that are crucial for testing and refining applications.
