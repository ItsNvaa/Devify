# All Products

Whether you are a seasoned developer fine-tuning your latest e-commerce platform or a newcomer eager to explore the intricacies of API integration, **Devify's [All Products]("https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products) endpoint is your gateway to a world of simulated products.**

Allows you to **retrieve a wide array of product data**, complete with details like **product names, descriptions, prices**, and more.

This API endpoint allows developers to retrieve an extensive list of all available products within the Devify ecosystem. It serves as a **valuable tool for testing and development**, enabling developers to fetch a comprehensive catalog of products to work with.

## How to Use It?

To access the complete array of product data, you have several elegant options at your disposal. You can employ tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or wield the power of [cURL](https://curl.se) to elegantly fetch the JSON data from Devify's products endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can use it to make HTTP requests from the command line or in your scripts. Here are some common use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products"
```

## Fetching Data

Alternatively, you may choose to embrace the versatility of **JavaScript** or another programming language, allowing you to gracefully retrieve the coveted product information from Devify's rich data repository.

The beauty of these methods lies in their adaptability, offering you a symphony of choices to harmonize with your development needs.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products?limit=3`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products?limit=3`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

#### Start your Application

```bash
$ node main.js
```

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "price": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "location": "...",
    "rating": "...",
    "stock": "...",
    "image": "..."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "price": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "location": "...",
    "rating": "...",
    "stock": "...",
    "image": "..."
  }
]
```

## HTTP Client Module

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the ability to seamlessly interact with APIs is paramount. This is where HTTP client modules like [Axios](https://axios-http.com) come into play, offering developers powerful tools to make HTTP requests and manage data within their applications.

Let's dive into how they can be harnessed to interact with APIs effectively, using a fictitious API known as Devify as our test and development environment.

### Installing

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Visit [https://axios-http.com](https://axios-http.com) to view the full documentation.

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}v1/products`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

HTTP Client Modules like [Axios](https://axios-http.com) make it easier for developers to interact with APIs such as Devify. These tools simplify the process of making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing data within your applications.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, integrating these modules into your project can greatly enhance your workflow and productivity.
