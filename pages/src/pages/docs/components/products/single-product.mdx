# Single Product

**We understand the importance of thorough testing and development in the software and application development process.** Our Fake API serves as an indispensable tool for developers, offering a wide range of functionalities to facilitate the testing of their applications.

**Developers can rely on Devify to create a safe and realistic environment for testing and refining their applications.** Developers can streamline the development process and build applications that are robust, reliable, and user-friendly.

With this API, developers can retrieve key details about a single product by providing relevant identifiers, such as a unique **product ID** or a specific **product key**. The returned data typically includes **product name, description, price, availability, and other essential attributes**, making it easier to integrate product information seamlessly into your application.

## How to Use It?

When it comes to gaining access to the full array of product data, a range of sophisticated options is at your fingertips. You have the choice to utilize powerful tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com), or you can harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data available at Devify's products endpoint.

For those who prefer [cURL](https://curl.se), it serves as a versatile means to execute HTTP requests, whether it's from the command line or within your scripts. Below, you will find a selection of typical scenarios and illustrative examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/1"
```

## Fetching Data

**To fetch data from Devify, developers can use standard HTTP requests**. This allows them to retrieve data in the format they need, such as JSON or XML. The responses from Devify are structured to resemble those of genuine APIs, providing a realistic testing environment.

### Single Product By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Single Product By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250be`
    );
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250be`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Response

```json
[
  {
    "product": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "AILIHEN MS300 Wired Headphones with Microphone for Chromebook Laptop Computer, 3.5mm Foldable Kids Headphones for School Teens Girls (Rose Gold)",
      "description": "Everything about AILIHEN MS300 has been designed for hassle-free use. With a simple wired cable, thereâ€™s no chance of lost connections or dead batteries. They are perfect for listening to music, watching movies, online education, and everything in between.",

    },
    "status": 200
  }
]
```

With Devify, you can test how your application handles different data scenarios, network conditions, and error responses. **This valuable resource helps you identify and address potential issues early in the development process, saving you time and ensuring a smoother user experience when your application goes live.**

## HTTP Client Module

Devify is a unique and versatile Fake API designed to cater to the specific needs of developers seeking a robust testing and development environment for their applications.

To enhance the development experience, Devify integrates seamlessly with popular HTTP client modules, including [Axios](https://axios-http.com). Let's take a closer look at how these modules empower developers to interact with the Devify API effectively.

### Single Product By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Single Product By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250be`
    );

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250be`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

Devify, coupled with HTTP client modules like [Axios](https://axios-http.com), creates a seamless and efficient testing and development environment for developers. It empowers developers to work with mock data, test various scenarios, and refine their applications in a controlled setting, ultimately enhancing the development process and product quality.
