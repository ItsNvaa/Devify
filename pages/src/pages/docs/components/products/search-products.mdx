# Search Products

This feature empowers developers to efficiently search and retrieve product data from their applications, making it an ideal resource for testing and refining search functionalities in their software. With Devify's, **developers can experiment with various search parameters, refine their search algorithms, and fine-tune the user experience.**

Whether you're building an e-commerce platform, a product catalog, or any application that involves searching for products, **Devify's simplifies the development process.** It allows developers to test and optimize search queries, ensuring that their applications provide users with a seamless and efficient product discovery experience.

## How to Use It?

When it comes to accessing a comprehensive set of product data, you have various advanced options at your disposal.** You can leverage robust tools like [Postman](https://postman.com), or you can employ the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to smoothly retrieve the JSON data provided by Devify's products endpoint.**

For those who prefer [cURL](https://curl.se), it acts as a versatile method for executing HTTP requests, whether you are working from the command line or within your scripts. Below, you will discover a range of common scenarios along with illustrative examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/search?q=samsung"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/search?q=samsung"
```

## Fetching Data

Developers often find themselves in need of extensive data to test their applications and simulate real-world scenarios. **Devify comes to the rescue by offering a straightforward and user-friendly mechanism for searching and fetching product data.**

This feature empowers developers to access and retrieve product data with precision and efficiency. **It allows developers to perform targeted searches for products, making it easier to test and optimize their applications.**

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/search?q=samsung`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/search?q=samsung`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

One common task in application development is searching for specific data within an API. This is where HTTP client modules like Axios come into play. [Axios](https://axios-http.com) is a popular **JavaScript** library for making HTTP requests, and it's widely used in the developer community. **It's not only easy to use but also highly versatile, making it an excellent choice for interacting with APIs like Devify.**

Suppose you're working with Devify and want to search for specific products within the API. **To achieve this, you can utilize Axios to send HTTP GET requests with the appropriate query parameters.** Let's break down the process:

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/search?q=samsung`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/search?q=samsung`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## Query Parameters

For developers, having access to a Fake API like Devify with robust query parameter support is a game-changer. It enables thorough testing of applications, ensuring they can handle diverse user queries effectively.

| Params | Data Types | Required |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| q      | String     | Yes      |
