# Delete Product

The procedure is straightforward and developer-friendly. By specifying the product's unique identifier or utilizing other relevant parameters, **developers can seamlessly remove products from their dataset. This ensures that the data remains clean, relevant, and in line with the evolving needs of the application.**

To delete a product within the Devify ecosystem, developers have a powerful set of tools at their disposal. **Whether it's removing obsolete items, conducting tests, or refining the application's functionality, the delete product feature simplifies the process.**

## How to Use It?

When it comes to accessing the complete range of product data, you have a variety of advanced options at your disposal. You can opt to use powerful tools like [Postman](https://postman.com), or you can leverage the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to smoothly retrieve the JSON data provided by Devify's products endpoint.

For those who prefer [cURL](https://curl.se), it serves as a versatile method for making HTTP requests, whether it's through the command line or within your scripts. Below, we've provided a set of common scenarios and illustrative examples:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250ef"
```

## Fetching Data

One crucial aspect of software development is data management. **Devify excels in this regard by providing a wide range of endpoints and methods, including the Delete Product feature.** This particular function allows developers to remove specific products from the dataset with ease.

When it comes to managing products in your application, the ability to remove a product is crucial. With Devify, **you can test this functionality without the need for a real database or the risk of damaging live data.**

### Delete Product By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteProduct() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`, { method: "DELETE" });
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteProduct().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteProduct() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250ef`,
      { method: "DELETE" }
    );
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteProduct().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

### Delete Product By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`, { method: "DELETE" })
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250ef`, {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## HTTP Client Module

**Deleting a product using the HTTP Client Module with Devify is a straightforward process, as long as your application is properly authenticated and you construct the DELETE request correctly.** Devify's comprehensive testing and development environment allows you to refine your application's functionality with confidence.

When your application interacts with Devify's simulated API, it's essential to handle various **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations effectively. **To delete a product, follow these steps:**

### Delete Product By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteProduct() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteProduct().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteProduct() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250ef`
    );

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteProduct().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

### Delete Product By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/1`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Product By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/key/650698cfb8318065fca250ef`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
