## How to Use It?

To access the full range of product information, you have various efficient options available. **You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's product endpoint.**

When using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to initiate HTTP requests through the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and illustrations:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/categories"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/categories"
```

## Fetching Data

Fetching data from Devify is a breeze. By making a simple API request, **developers can access a wealth of product categories, facilitating the creation of applications that are not only functional but also reflect real-world scenarios.**

Whether you're working on an e-commerce platform, a content management system, or any application requiring product categorization, **Devify's is an invaluable resource.**

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

## HTTP Client Module

In the world of web development, testing and development environments are invaluable. **Devify, a Fake API, offers a solution for developers seeking to test their applications without relying on real data.** It's a fantastic resource for honing your skills and ensuring your software functions as intended.

One common task in app development is retrieving product categories, which can be a crucial part of many e-commerce platforms. **In this guide, we'll show you how to use [Axios](https://axios-http.com), an HTTP client module, to fetch all product categories from Devify's API.**

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
