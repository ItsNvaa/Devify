# Single Categories

This feature proves invaluable for those building applications with complex product hierarchies or requiring specific category-related information.

By simply specifying the category's unique identifier, **developers can obtain a wealth of information, from category names and descriptions to any other relevant data associated with the category.**

---

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of product information, you have a variety of effective methods available. You can utilize tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to efficiently retrieve the JSON data from Devify's product endpoint.

When using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can leverage it for making HTTP requests via the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and illustrative instances:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/categories/jewelry"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/products/categories/jewelry"
```

## Fetching Data

Having a capability to access single categories is essential for various reasons. **Developers can use this feature to fine-tune their applications, test specific components, or retrieve particular sets of data to ensure the correct functionality of their software.**

One of the key features provided by Devify, a Fake API specifically designed to offer developers a robust testing and development environment for their applications, is the ability to retrieve single categories.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories/jewelry`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories/jewelry`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

**Devify is a valuable resource for developers seeking to test and develop their applications in a controlled environment**. It offers a range of endpoints to interact with a variety of data. In this guide, we'll focus on how to use [Axios](https://axios-http.com), a popular **JavaScript** HTTP client, to retrieve a single category from Devify's API.

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function products() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories/mens`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

products().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/products/categories/mens`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
