# Search Books

Searching for books is a common task in application development, whether you're building a book catalog, a library management system, or an online bookstore. **Devify's feature allows developers to simulate and test book search functionalities with ease. It provides developers with a simulated dataset of books, complete with various attributes like titles, authors, genres, and descriptions.**

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of search query books data, there are various sophisticated options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve JSON data from Devify's books endpoint.

If you choose to use [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it for making HTTP requests either from the command line or within your scripts. Below are some typical scenarios and examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/search?q=interstellar"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/search?q=interstellar"
```

## Fetching Data

**Searching for information in a vast sea of data is a fundamental aspect of modern applications.** In the realm of software development, having a reliable and accessible source of data is crucial for creating, testing, and fine-tuning applications. This is where Devify steps in.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/search?q=interstellar`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/search?q=interstellar`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

When it comes to making HTTP requests to interact with APIs, developers commonly turn to HTTP client libraries like [Axios](https://axios-http.com). [Axios](https://axios-http.com) is a JavaScript-based library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests in both the browser and Node.js. **It provides an elegant and straightforward way to send HTTP requests and handle responses.**

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/search?q=interstellar`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/search?q=interstellar`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
