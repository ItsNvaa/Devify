# Single Categories

Devify is a powerful and versatile Fake API designed to cater to **the needs of developers by providing them with an ideal testing and development environment for their applications.** When it comes to organizing and retrieving specific categories of data..

Developers often require precise and targeted data to fine-tune their applications. **Devify allows developers to fetch individual categories of data with ease. Whether you're building an e-commerce platform and need to retrieve product categories, or you're developing a content management.**

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of single-category book data, you have several efficient options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's books endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to initiate HTTP requests either directly from the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical use cases and examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/categories/history"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/categories/history"
```

## Fetching Data

In a world where efficient data retrieval is paramount, Devify steps in as a powerful ally. **This function allows developers to access specific categories within their applications effortlessly. With a user-friendly interface and well-documented endpoints, Devify simplifies the process of obtaining single categories, making it an essential tool in a developer's toolkit.**

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories/history`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories/history`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

**This HTTP Client Module simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to the Devify server.** It emulates the functionality of popular HTTP client libraries like [Axios](https://axios-http.com), providing developers with a familiar and user-friendly interface for communicating with the Devify API.

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories/fiction`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories/fiction`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
