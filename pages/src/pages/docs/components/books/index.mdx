# All Books

In the realm of software development, access to a comprehensive library of fictitious books can be invaluable. Devify, with its user-friendly API, **allows developers to effortlessly retrieve a complete list of fictional books for testing and development purposes.**

By making use of this feature, **developers can easily fetch a wide range of book data, from titles and authors to genres and descriptions.** The data obtained can be used to simulate a real-world book database, facilitating the testing of search, sorting, and filtering functionalities within your application.

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of book data, you have several effective options available. You can utilize tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capability of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's books endpoint.

If you choose to use [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it for making HTTP requests through the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and illustrative examples:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books"
```

## Fetching Data

In the world of software development, having a reliable and versatile testing and development environment is crucial for creating and fine-tuning applications. **Devify steps in as the perfect solution. Devify is a specialized Fake API meticulously crafted to cater to the needs of developers.** It offers a seamless experience for testing and developing applications, making the process smoother and more efficient.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books?limit=3`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books?limit=3`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

#### Start your Application

```bash
$ node main.js
```

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "...",
    "synopsis": "...",
    "author": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "publisher": "...",
    "published": "...",
    "language": "...",
    "rating": 4.7,
    "pages": 365,
    "poster": "..."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "...",
    "synopsis": "...",
    "author": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "publisher": "...",
    "published": "...",
    "language": "...",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "pages": 256,
    "poster": "..."
  }
]
```

## HTTP Client Module

When developing and testing applications, having access to a reliable and flexible API for data is crucial. **Devify steps in as a convenient solution, offering a Fake API specifically designed for developers to create, test, and develop their applications.**

One common task for developers is retrieving a list of books from an API, and [Axios](https://axios-http.com), a popular **JavaScript** library for making HTTP requests, simplifies this process. Let's walk through how to use [Axios](https://axios-http.com) to fetch all books from Devify API.

### Installing

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Visit [https://axios-http.com](https://axios-http.com) to view the full documentation.

### Examples

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}v1/books`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
