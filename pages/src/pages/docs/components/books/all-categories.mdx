# All Categories

This feature allows developers to effortlessly retrieve a comprehensive list of book categories within their applications. **Whether you're working on an e-commerce platform, a digital library, or any application that deals with books, Devify's simplifies the process of categorizing and organizing your book collection.**

By accessing this endpoint, you can retrieve a structured list of book genres, from science fiction and fantasy to non-fiction and self-help. **The categorization provides a user-friendly experience for your application's users, allowing them to explore books that match their interests with ease.**

## How to Use It?

To access the full array of book categories data, you have several convenient options available. You can utilize tools such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's books endpoint.

If you choose to use [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to initiate HTTP requests either via the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and illustrations:

```bash
$ curl -o C:\output.json -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/categories"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/categories"
```

## Fetching Data

**One of the fundamental functionalities offered by Devify is the ability to retrieve all book categories, providing developers with a seamless mechanism for fetching data.** This is particularly valuable when building applications that involve bookstores, libraries, or any project related to the literary world.

### Examples

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories`);
    const result = await response.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## HTTP Client Module

If you're working on an application that involves books and **you need to retrieve a list of all book categories, you can do so using an HTTP client module like [Axios](https://axios-http.com).** [Axios](https://axios-http.com) is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, and it's well-suited for working with APIs, including Devify.

To get all book categories from Devify, follow these steps using [Axios](https://axios-http.com):

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function books() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

books().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .get(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/categories`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
