# Delete Book

**In the world of software development, testing and refining applications is an essential part of the process.** Devify, a Fake API designed with developers in mind, offers a convenient platform for testing and development. Today, we'll explore a fundamental operation: deleting a book.

As developers, we often work with databases and APIs to manage and manipulate data. In real-world applications, deleting records is a common task. Devify makes this task simple and user-friendly, **allowing developers to hone their skills without the risks associated with working on live systems.**

## How to Use It?

To delete a book, you have several effective options available. You can utilize tools like [Postman](https://postman.com) or harness the capabilities of [cURL](https://curl.se) to gracefully retrieve the JSON data from Devify's books endpoint.

If you're using [cURL](https://curl.se), you can employ it to issue HTTP requests from the command line or within your scripts. Here are some typical scenarios and examples:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/1"
```

OR

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE "https://api-devify.my.id/v1/books/key/650a7b4c6571ac2061f0c375"
```

## Fetching Data

**Devify is a dynamic and versatile Fake API crafted to offer developers a reliable testing and development environment for their applications.** It serves as an invaluable tool, particularly when it comes to managing data, testing different functionalities, and refining the overall performance of your software solutions.

**One of the essential operations developers frequently need to perform is deleting specific data elements, like a book from a catalog.** In this context, Devify shines as an ideal companion.

### Delete Book By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteBook() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/1`, { method: "DELETE" });
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteBook().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

### Delete Book By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteBook() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/books/key/650a7b4c6571ac2061f0c375`,
      { method: "DELETE" }
    );
    const result = await res.json();

    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteBook().then((datas) => console.log(datas));
```

OR

### Delete Book By ID

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/1`, { method: "DELETE" })
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Book By Uniquekey

```js
const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/key/650a7b4c6571ac2061f0c375`, {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

## HTTP Client Module

To interact with Devify's Fake API, we can employ a popular HTTP client module like [Axios](https://axios-http.com). **[Axios](https://axios-http.com) simplifies the process of making HTTP requests from your application to external APIs or services.**

Let's assume you have an application where users can manage their book collections, and you want to remove a book from the collection. To achieve this using [Axios](https://axios-http.com) and Devify, follow these steps:

### Delete Book By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteBook() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/1`);

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteBook().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Delete Book By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

async function deleteBook() {
  try {
    const res = await axios.delete(
      `${baseUrl}/v1/books/key/650a7b4c6571ac2061f0c375`
    );

    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}

deleteBook().then((result) => console.log(result));
```

OR

### Delete Book By ID

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/1`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

### Delete Book By Uniquekey

```js
import axios from "axios";

const baseUrl = "https://api-devify.my.id";

axios
  .delete(`${baseUrl}/v1/books/key/650a7b4c6571ac2061f0c375`)
  .then((res) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
